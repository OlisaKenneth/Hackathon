# Future Roadmap (SumData)

## 1) More Healthcare Paperwork Support
Extend SumData beyond visit notes to help draft:
- Insurance-related documentation (claims forms, supporting letters)
- Referral forms
- Work/school notes (clinician-approved)
- Intake forms and follow-up forms

## 2) Stronger Offline Clinical Resource Pack
- Signed offline update bundles (admin-controlled)
- More Canadian clinical templates (province/clinic configurable)
- Multilingual terminology support

## 3) Better Clinical Structure
- More complete SOAP notes (Objective + vitals if entered)
- Problem lists, medication reconciliation, allergy checks
- Template-based outputs per department (family medicine, ER, etc.)

## 4) Integration (Optional / Advanced)
- Export structured formats (FHIR-style) for EHR integration
- Secure clinic portal delivery for patient summaries

## 5) Accessibility & Inclusion
- Multilingual patient summaries
- Plain-language levels (Grade 6–8)
- Hearing accessibility: transcript-first workflows

## 6) Evaluation & Validation
- Clinician evaluation studies: time saved, error rate, satisfaction
- Privacy/security review prior to deployment
